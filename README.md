## How the Project Works

The E-Commerce Web Project aims to replicate the experience of an online shopping platform. By utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the e-commerce API provided by author Prakash Sakari, the project delivers an immersive shopping experience reminiscent of popular e-commerce websites.

### Overview

Upon entering the e-commerce website, users are greeted with a visually appealing storefront showcasing a variety of products available for purchase.

### Features

1. **Product Showcase:** The central focus of the webpage is the collection of products, each presented with a high-quality image, title, price, and "Add to Cart" button.

2. **Category Filtering:** Users can explore products by filtering them based on different categories. Clicking on a specific category updates the displayed products to show only those that belong to the selected category.

3. **Product Search:** The project offers a robust search feature allowing users to search for products by their titles. As users type in the search bar, the displayed products update to match their input in real-time.

4. **Hover Animation:** To enhance the visual experience, a subtle zoom transition animation is applied to product images when users hover over them. This animation provides users with a closer view of the product details.

5. **Add to Cart:** For each product, an "Add to Cart" button enables users to include items in their virtual shopping cart. The cart reflects the selected products and quantities.
